# Dope Theme

A dark minimal theme, with cosier controls, and customisable colour.

It was designed to be used with [qxSceneCard](https://github.com/QxxxGit/stash-plugins/tree/main/plugins/qxSceneCard), but should work well enough with the default cards.

In the plugin settings, you can change the primary colour to any valid CSS string, e.g. `#fff` or `rgb(255,255,255)`
